This program is a Django project and app for a virtual computer lab using amazon resources.

Configuration at this point is pretty much diy.

1.  If you already have a Django project you can just install the lab app
2.  You need to have your own amazon account and createa a .boto file in your home directory with your AWS credentials.
3.  At the moment many possible lab creation variables are hard coded - this needs to change
4.  Once you register a lab in the Django admin module any user who is registered with the Django project can login and launch these machines
